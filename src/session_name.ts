 * run of every repository, so an event carrying it says nothing beyond the role
 * that was assumed.
 *
 * The owner and the repository are left out. A run id is unique across GitHub,
 * and the AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity event that opened the session records the
 * sub claim of the OIDC token, which names the repository. Joining the two
 * events on the access key id of the session gets there, whereas fitting a
 * repository name into what's left of 64 characters would sometimes truncate it,
 * and a name that is sometimes complete and sometimes not is worse than one
 * that never is.
